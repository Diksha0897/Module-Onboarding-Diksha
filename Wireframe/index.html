        <h2>What is the purpose of a README file?</h2>
        <p>
      The purpose of a <b>README file</b> is to provide essential information about a project, 
      including what it does, how to install and use it, and any important details such as 
      requirements, licensing, or contribution guidelines. It helps users and developers 
      understand and work with the project more easily.

        <h2>What is a wireframe in project development?</h2>
        <p>
      A <b>wireframe</b> is a visual representation or blueprint of a project's layout and structure. 
      It outlines the basic elements and functionality of a user interface without focusing on 
      design details. Wireframes help in planning the user experience and organizing content before 
      moving on to more detailed design and development stages.

        <h2>What is a branch in a git ?</h2>
        <p>
      In software development, it’s common for multiple people to work on different parts of a project at the same time. 
       A <strong>Git branch</strong> makes that possible without breaking anything.
       When you create a branch, you’re basically making a copy of your code where you can experiment safely. 
       You can add new features, fix bugs, or test ideas and if everything works, you can merge those changes back into the main version. 
       If things go wrong, your main code stays safe and sound.
